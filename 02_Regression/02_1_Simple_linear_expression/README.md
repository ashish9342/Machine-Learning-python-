# Simple Linear Expression Intuition

> y = b0 + b1 * x1

`y` is the dependent variable
`x` is the  independent variable
`b1` coefficient
`b0` constant term, point that crosses vertical y-axis

Program shows how the salary is related to the year of experience.

> Salary = b0 + b1 * Experience

```
SUM (y - y^)^2 => min
```
